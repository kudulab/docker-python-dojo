# docker-python-dojo

A Dojo docker image with Python. Based on [official Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/).

## Specification

This image has installed:
 * python 3
 * virtualenv, tox, devpi-client

If you want to use a [devpi server](http://doc.devpi.net), set environment variables:
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_INDEX` - if it is set, then `devpi use --set-cfg --pip-set-trusted=yes "${KUDU_DEVPI_INDEX}"` will be run
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_LOGIN` - if it is set, then `devpi login --password "${KUDU_DEVPI_PASSWORD}" "${KUDU_DEVPI_LOGIN}"` will be run
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_PASSWORD` - may be empty

## Usage
1. Setup docker.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) binary.
3. Provide a Dojofile:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/python-dojo:2.0.1"
# or:
# DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/python-dojo:latest"
```
4. Create and enter the container by running `dojo` at the root of project.
```bash
dojo "python --help"
```

By default, current directory in docker container is `/dojo/work`.


## Development
### Dependencies

## Contributing
Instructions how to update this project.

1. Create a new feature branch from the main branch
1. Work on your changes in that feature branch. If you want, describe you changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
1. Build your image locally to check that it succeeds: `./tasks build`
1. Test your image locally: `./tasks itest`. You may need to install the test framework - you can do it following [these instructions](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-terraform-dojo/blob/master/tasks#L66)
1. If you are happy with the results, create a PR from your feature branch to master branch

After this, someone will read your PR, merge it and ensure version bump (using `./tasks set_version`). CI pipeline will run to automatically build and test docker image, release the project and publish the docker image.

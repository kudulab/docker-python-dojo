# docker-python-dojo

A Dojo docker image with Python. Based on [official Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/).

## Specification

This image has installed:
 * python (either 2.7 or 3.7, choose particular docker image tag)
 * virtualenv, tox, devpi-client

If you want to use a [devpi server](http://doc.devpi.net), set environment variables:
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_INDEX` - if it is set, then `devpi use --set-cfg --pip-set-trusted=yes "${KUDU_DEVPI_INDEX}"` will be run
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_LOGIN` - if it is set, then `devpi login --password "${KUDU_DEVPI_PASSWORD}" "${KUDU_DEVPI_LOGIN}"` will be run
   * `KUDU_DEVPI_PASSWORD` - may be empty

## Usage
1. Setup docker.
2. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) binary.
3. Provide a Dojofile:
```
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/python-dojo:py3-1.0.0"
# or:
# DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/python-dojo:py2-1.0.0"
```
4. Create and enter the container by running `dojo` at the root of project.
```bash
dojo "python --help"
```

By default, current directory in docker container is `/dojo/work`.


## Development
### Dependencies
* Bash
* Docker daemon
* Bats
* [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo)


### Lifecycle
1. In a feature branch:
    * you make changes and add some docs to changelog (do not insert date or version)
    * you build docker images: `./tasks build_local_py3`, `./tasks build_local_py2`
    * and test them: `./tasks itest_py3`, `./tasks itest_py2`
    * to test it interactively: `./tasks example`
1. You decide that your changes are ready and you:
    * merge into master branch
    * run locally:
      * `./tasks set_version` to bump the patch version fragment by 1 OR
      * e.g. `./tasks set_version 1.2.3` to bump to a particular version
    * push to master onto private git server
1. CI server (GoCD) tests and releases.
